# SikshaLokam
Siksha Chaupal is a project dedicated to improving education for girls and children in rural Bihar and northern India. While this initiative is inspiring, it faces challenges due to poor documentation. This lack of proper records makes it difficult to secure grants and funding from NGOs and nonprofit organizations.
